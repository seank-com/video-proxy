# video-proxy
A proof of concept using multiple WebRTC connections instead of a TURN server.

## Build

```bash
$ docker build -t video-proxy:latest .
```

## Run

## Overview

The blog post [Getting Start with WebRTC](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/) contains lots of good information about WebRTC.
- The article starts with a [link](https://appr.tc/) to a browser based demo ([src](https://github.com/webrtc/apprtc)). This is just one of many [samples](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/).
- The section on [signaling](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/#toc-signaling) discusses how to use sockets for signaling. 
- The section [RTCPeerConnection without servers](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/#toc-sans) demonstrates how to avoid signaling altogether.
- The section [RTCPeerConnection plus servers](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/#toc-real) discusses the role of STUN and TURN servers and has a link to an [article](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/) with even more detailed information.

## Notes from [WebRTC in the real world: STUN, TURN and signaling](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/)

- To test credentials you can use the [candidate gathering sample](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/) and check if you get a candidate with type relay.

### Idea

>Are there any off the shelf STUN/TURN servers ready for deployment? See [orchestrating TURN server deployment](https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2018/01/29/orchestrating-turn-servers-cloud-deployment/) and [Deploying STUN and TURN servers](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#deploying-stun-and-turn-servers)

- It would also be possible to run a WebRTC endpoint on a server and construct your own redistribution mechanism (a [sample client application](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftalk) is provided by webrtc.org).

- Since Chrome 31 and Opera 18, a MediaStream from one RTCPeerConnection can be used as the input for another: there's a demo at [simpl.info/multi](http://simpl.info/rtcpeerconnection/multi). This can enable more flexible architectures, since it enables a web app to handle call routing by choosing which other peer to connect to.

### Idea

>Instead of a STUN/TURN server have a WebRTC client in the cloud and have each end connect to it. See [node-webrtc](https://github.com/node-webrtc/node-webrtc) or [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/)
